# Research
I used to main ways of research. The first being watching my classmates buold their and looking at their ideas and building off them. The second being these two videos where I learned some basic tips and strategies

# Ideation
# Prototyping
for prototyping i used many diffrent ways to construct a plan to build. My main goal was to find strategies that worked the best and make as many as possible to see the best outcome.

My main plan as seen in the photos were to play around with folding, tieing and shapes
# Testing and Critiquing

Here you can see my elaboration on folding, this time I added slits to make more support, this helped make my prototype better and taller. My next step was the final build and i wanted to acoomplish a more stable base, better support and cuts. This would lead to a taller tower
# Final Design

My final design is my testing idea but better designed, I took more time to measure exact distances so the pieces were exactly even at 2.83 a piece. I then cut it perfectly so the bases were even. The next step was to fold in the middle as if done wrong I the base would be week, after folding each piece in the middle horizontally I cut small slits 0.5 inches from the middle fold of each piece, the slits were 2 cm deep allowing good support but maximaizing height  .This then completed my final attempt where i got all 3 pieces stacked with the slit for just under 70cm. 
# Conclusion
Reflecting back I realized that I could've done better if I changed my plan and tied as that was more successful, basing it on my success I was happy with what I accomplished. I think others could have made better folds and even made a 4 or possibly a 5 piece on top to make it taller and more successful.
